# Main Task

Your task is to create a new website for our company which will display all we do at Systems Technologies.
This is the [design](https://xd.adobe.com/embed/458cfe85-e88b-4dc6-9e45-2a92ca863515-10df/) you will follow.

## Section (`/section name `)

Since the site is a single page website the Nav is only to navigate to each section.

## Icons

All icons and images you needed are already provided for you in the images folder.

# Technical Requirements

The application should at the very least use the following:

- JavaScript **or** TypeScript
- React.js
- CSS
  - Tailwind CSS **or** Bootstrap **or** your own CSS structure (you can use any other CSS frameworks)
  - A CSS pre-compiler (SASS, LESS, SCSS) or other CSS approaches (CSS modules, Styled components)
- The website should be responsive. It should **be usable on mobile and tablets**. There are no mockups for mobile and tablet views, adapt it to your taste.
